I embarked on an analytics dashboard journey by partnering with the CEO of [Elite Meet](www.elitemeet.us) - a non-profit Veterans Service Organization (VSO) that help military veterans from Special Operations units transition into Corporate America after they leave service.  This was a full-cycle data project beginning with delivering an initial value proposition to preparing the data all the way through deployment of an analytics platform in the cloud for use by the CEO.  Here is what I learned...  

- [x] **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: A single-page, working dashboard connected to a local datasource.  Dashboard is visually appealing. 
- [x] **MVP+** : Multipage dashboard app deployed on a remote server.  Automated data pulls from original data source. 
- [ ] **MVP++** : Fully functioning app, modularized i.e. easy to maintain and update, and hardened for production.  User authentication required.
